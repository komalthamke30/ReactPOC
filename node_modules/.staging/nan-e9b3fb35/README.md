Thanks to the crazy changes in V8 (and some in Node core), keeping native addons compiling happily across versions, particularly 0.10 to 0.12 to 4.0, is a minor nightmare. The goal of this project is to store all logic necessary to develop native Node.js addons without having to inspect `NODE_MODULE_VERSION` and get yourself into a macro-tangle.

This project also contains some helper utilities that make addon development a bit more pleasant.

## Usage

Simply add **NAN** as a dependency in the *package.json* of your Node addon:

``` bash
$ npm install --save nan
```

Pull in the path to **NAN** in your *binding.gyp* so that you can use `#include <nan.h>` in your *.cpp* files:

``` python
"include_dirs" : [
    "<!(node -e \"require('nan')\")"
]
```

This works like a `-I<path-to-NAN>` when compiling your addon.

## Example

Just getting started with Nan? Take a look at the **[Node Add-on Examples](https://github.com/nodejs/node-addon-examples)**.

Refer to a [quick-start **Nan** Boilerplate](https://github.com/fcanas/node-native-boilerplate) for a ready-to-go project that utilizes basic Nan functionality.

For a simpler example, see the **[async pi estimation example](https://github.com/nodejs/nan/tree/master/examples/async_pi_estimate)** in the examples directory for full code and an explanation of what this Monte Carlo Pi estimation example does. Below are just some parts of the full example that illustrate the use of **NAN**.
